# Social Network API - NoSQL

## Description

The Social Network API Challenge is a project that involves building an API for a social network web application. In this challenge, you'll use Express.js for routing, MongoDB as a NoSQL database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool.

- CRUD operations: Implementing API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users and thoughts.
